* I made an online sales program for one of my favorite meals, Pizza. It is decorated not only with sales, but also with price calculation according to the product content and visual content according to the product type. If the user wants to make a special pizza for himself, there is a special interface for it.


## HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content can be structured using a series of paragraphs, bullet points, or images and data tables.

The reason for using html code is to have a visually comfortable movement and to avoid possible confusion due to the user's use of the interface and the different types of products.
